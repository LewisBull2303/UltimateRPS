Ultimate Rock Paper Scissors,

This project was a fund take on the traditional game of rock paper scissors, including 12 new options to choose from. I chose to make this project as I used to love playing Ultimare Rock Paper Scissors with my Friends and so I chose to make something which I find Fun.

Ultimate Rock Paper Scissors is a conveluted mess of a game with 15 options to chose from but is, in my opinion, infinately more fun than standard Rock Paper Scissors.


Features:

Existing features

 .  Buttons to play
	In the game area there is 15 different buttonw which coorospond to differnt symbol and options to play

 . Chart
	Below the buttons is a handy chart to see what options beat what when playing

 .The Score Area
	Just below the buttons there is a scoring area which allows the user to see how many time they have won vs how many times the computer has won


Features to impliment
 . I could Impliment in the future a more appealing looking background for the game or potentially animations


Testing

Throuighout the project I did rigorous testing and have personally confirmed that each option wins against everything that it should and loses against everything that it should. I have tested that the score cou8nters go up to at least 100 for both the wins and the loses, I have also ensured that the project files will work on other browsers.
