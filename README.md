## Design

### Design Choices
The design was chosen to create a modern, arcade-inspired aesthetic, blending vibrant colors and bold elements that evoke the energy of classic arcade games. The intention was to make key objects on the page stand out, using contrasting colors to naturally guide the player's attention. This visual strategy enhances the overall user experience, making the interface engaging and intuitive while staying true to the playful, dynamic feel of an arcade environment. Additionally all buttons respond to the user hovering and clicking on them providing instant feedback to the user.

### Color

The colors I chose were a green, black, white and various grey slate colors. This was to make the feel of a neon arcade. Some objects have a glow to them which help the vibe of a neon arcade game. The Red was chosen as a stark contrast to the neutral colours and to give the glow that neon signs have. The white, greys and blacks were chosen as a base color template which allows the red neon colour to really pop at the user and draw their attention. When the player wins there is a green colour for the victory text. When the player draws the text turns into a gold, and when the player loses the text turns red. Additonaly If I wanted something to add bold there is an indigo colour which was unused but in the code.

- Rose Colour: #e11d48
- Green Colour: #006400
- Gold Colour: #Ffd700
- Dark Colour: #070a13
- Light Colour: #f1f5f9
- Grey Slate 400: #94a3b8
- Grey Slate 600: #475569
- Grey Slate 800: #1e293b
- Indigo Colour: #4f46e5

##   Fonts
The font that I chose for UltimateRPS is Satoshi and sans-serif as a backup. Satoshi gave the website a very modern look and gave the web page personality whilst still not drawing the focus the away from the main game.

## Structure
The Structure of the site is made to make the users focus drawn to the game and its componants. When the user opens the page the interactable objects are in the rose colour and glowing to it is intuitively clear to the user that they can be clicked and interacted with. This allows the users to come to the site and play the game straight away as it is clear which parts are intereactable. This also allows for the user to feel welcome and then allows them to jump straight into the game.
 - The home page has clear interactable objects that glow which allows the user to intuitively know how to play the game.
 - There is buttons for social media links which then link to my social medias on the home page.
 - All objects are structured to be able to work on all types of devices.

## Wireframe

My wireframe concept was a single page, which would have everything that the user needed on there, there would be the home page where the user can select the amount of rounds and then click play, where all of the buttons they can click would pop up and the amount of rounds would be at the top. Then when the game was over a screen saying if they won or lost would appear and it woul show the score, with a button underneath to play again.

## Testing

 - I tested that this page works in different browsers: Edge, Firefox Chrome, Safari and OperaGX
 - I confirmed that this project is responsive, looks good and functions on all standard screen sizes using the devtools in chrome and edge.
 - I confirmed that all text is easy to read and has correct spelling and grammar in places where needed.
 - I have confimed that all buttons fucntion as intended.

## Bugs

- There was a bug where the text for the result did not update to green or red when the user won or lost and would remain one color
- I fixed this by making the red-Text and green-Text class which gets removed and added when needed
  
- There was another bug with the remaining rounds not updating when the user got a tie
- This bug was fixed by changing where remaing rounds gets updated which meant that the update happened everytime the buttons were clicked
  
- Another bug was that the select bar was larger than the screen size when on small screen sizes
- I fixed this by setting the select bar to 75% width which ensured that the bar remained at a good size no matter the screen size
  
## Validator Testing
