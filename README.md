# Ultimate Rock Paper Scissors

This website is a fun game that I used to play with friends. It is an advanced version of Rock Paper Scissors that adds many new choices for the player and is more fun than the original.

This website is made for game enthusiasts and people who enjoy learning new versions of classic games.

## Design

### Design Choices

The design was chosen to create a modern, arcade-inspired aesthetic, blending vibrant colours and bold elements that evoke the energy of classic arcade games. The intention was to make key objects on the page stand out, using contrasting colours to naturally guide the player's attention. This visual strategy enhances the overall user experience, making the interface engaging and intuitive while staying true to the playful, dynamic feel of an arcade environment. Additionally, all buttons respond to the user hovering and clicking on them, providing instant feedback to the user.

### Colour

The colours I chose were a green, black, white, and various grey slate colours. This was to make the feel of a neon arcade. Some objects have a glow to them, which helps the vibe of a neon arcade game. The red was chosen as a stark contrast to the neutral colours and to give the glow that neon signs have. The whites, greys, and blacks were chosen as a base colour template, which allows the red neon colour to really pop at the user and draw their attention. When the player wins, there is a green colour for the victory text. When the player draws, the text turns into gold, and when the player loses, the text turns red. Additionally If I wanted something to add bold, there is an indigo colour that was unused but in the code.

- Rose Colour: #e11d48

- Green Colour: #006400

- Gold Colour: #Ffd700

- Dark Colour: #070a13

- Light Colour: #f1f5f9

- Grey Slate 400: #94a3b8

- Grey Slate 600: #475569

- Grey Slate 800: #1e293b

- Indigo Colour: #4f46e5

### Colour Palette:

## Fonts

The font that I chose for UltimateRPS is Satoshi and sans-serif as a backup. Satoshi gave the website a very modern look and gave the web page personality whilst still not drawing the focus away from the main game.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9f70104-5edb-44aa-a0d5-a94ae95dc534)

## Structure

The structure of the site is made to make the users focus drawn to the game and its components. When the user opens the page, the interactable objects are in the rose colour and glowing, so it is intuitively clear to the user that they can be clicked and interacted with. This allows the users to come to the site and play the game straight away, as it is clear which parts are interactable. This also allows for the user to feel welcome and then allows them to jump straight into the game.

 - The home page has clear, interactable objects that glow, which allows the user to intuitively know how to play the game.

 - There are buttons for social media links, which then link to my social media on the home page.

 - All objects are structured to be able to work on all types of devices.

## Wireframe

My wireframe concept was a single page, which would have everything that the user needed on there. There would be the home page where the user can select the amount of rounds and then click play, where all of the buttons they can click would pop up, and the amount of rounds would be at the top. Then when the game was over, a screen saying if they won or lost would appear, and it would show the score, with a button underneath to play again.

## Bugs

|What was the Bug?|What was the Fix?|
|---|---|
|There was a bug where the text for the result did not update to green or red when the user won or lost.| I fixed this by making the red-text and green-text classes, which I can remove and add when needed.|
|The remaining rounds were not updating when the user got a tie.|I fixed this by changing where the remaining rounds get updated, which resolved the issue.|
|The select bar was larger than the screen size on smaller screens|I set the select bar to 75% width, which ensures it stays the correct size.|
|The Continue button would not keep the number of rounds.|I made sure to reset the number of rounds when the continue button was clicked to match the remaining rounds again.|
|The new game button would not change the score back|Updated the code to reset the score and the player choices so it looks like a new game|

## Validator Testing


### HTML

- No errors were returned when passing through the W3C validator. One warning was returned; however, this is for a header that is updated and JavaScript, so the header needs to remain blank for the code to run correctly.

### JavaScript Validator

 - Passed my script.js through the JSHint validator. It passed with one issue, which is one unused function. This is not unused, as this is called when the user clicks a choice on the game page; however, that is not on the Javascript and is done on the HTML. Proof is in the image below:
